									<p>Posted  by David Luvahaby, In support to the above the NHS Digital (2020) observes that utilizing medical hardware on clinical networks has three related issues: First, it is mandatory that security updates, patches and potentially virus signatures are accurately evaluated by the supplier and certified to be harmless prior to being deployed on the target medical hardware. Second, when security updates are released, they are retro-analyzed by hackers, accumulating the probability that exploitable vulnerabilities will become recognized. Third, absence of latest security mitigations intensifies the effect of vulnerabilities, creating favorable conditions for breaches occurring without detection. NHS Digital (2020) acknowledges that breaches related to security of connected medical hardware can cause substantial interruption to the service delivery in healthcare.

									<p>Posted by Kin Wong , Besides technical issues, I think human factor is the highest potential risk of cyber security, which is also another possible factor under the scenario.
According to the Sky News today (2021) the IT systems of the Ireland’s health service are all being shut down because of significant ransomware attack, which maybe happened due to any human error.
According to Joseph (2021), he stated 5 network security risks which are happened by human error: The 1st one is allow the attacker connects to the network easily and physically, such as from any network plug, inside the hospital. It may be an ethernet port on the back of the desktop hub, switch or router.
The 2nd one is the devices can be accessed by some 3rd parties. They can be medical device manufacturers, regulators, and so on. There is a risk for any 3rd party to access and attack the network.
The 3rd one is the hospital never expires any vulnerable devices, which may create security risk. For example, Windows XP and 7, which the Microsoft has stopped to provide any patch and service pack.
The 4th reason is the organization’s policies and assessing compliance are not enough to defend the devices from being compromised, even though they all are compliant. As the medical devices need to operate 24x7, the risk of data loss will be increased also.
