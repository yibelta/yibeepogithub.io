Malicious Input to Content filters
The U.S children internet protection Act (CIPA) mandate that public schools and libraries employ mechanisms to block inappropriate matters protect minors this supported by principle 1.1 protection due to wellbeing of others and environment. Blocker plus software is automated internet content filter to help the institution comply with CIPA this in line with principle 2.3 which include
         -develop your profession (knowledge, skill and competence)
         -maintaining awareness on recent technology
Due to the challenge of continually updating the blacklist, the makers of blocker plus have begun to explore machine learning technics to automate the identification of inappropriate content without consultations of both the institution and the users this total violet principle 2.5 to respect and value alternative viewpoints, accept and offer honest critics of work this include brief information about scope and limitations of the services. Additional it denies principle 2.5 that extraordinary care is required when deploying machine learning systems. During a recent review session, the development team reviewed a number of recent complaints about content being blocked inappropriately so principle 2.8 declares that this insufficient justifications for this misuse. Based on the above scenario there is strong and weak side of using blocker plus software for the institution from ethical and professional perspective.

Summary Post

59 days ago
This ACM code of ethics and professional, which concerns the quality of life of all people, affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society, its members, and the environment surrounding them. This obligation includes: Promoting fundamental human rights and protecting each individual’s right to autonomy.
An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computing, including threats to health, safety, personal security, and privacy. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was to address concerns about children's access to obscene or harmful content over the Internet. Schools subject to CIPA have two additional certification requirements: Their Internet safety policies must include monitoring the online activities of minors; and as required by the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act, they must provide for educating minors about appropriate online behavior.  Schools and libraries subject to CIPA are required to adopt and implement an Internet safety policy addressing:
      Access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet; The safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications; Unauthorized access, including so-called “hacking,” and other unlawful activities  by minors online;  Unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and
Measures restricting minors' access to materials harmful to them but this is not blocking appropriate information for minors like the cases of blocker plus system in that specific institution. Additional like blocker plus system should respect Principle 2.5 mandates that extraordinary care is required when deploying machine learning systems and Principle 3.7 emphasizes that the developers of such systems have an added responsibility to provide good stewardship BCS (2021).

									<p>Posted by Kin Wong , Besides technical issues, I think human factor is the highest potential risk of cyber security, which is also another possible factor under the scenario.
According to the Sky News today (2021) the IT systems of the Ireland’s health service are all being shut down because of significant ransomware attack, which maybe happened due to any human error.
According to Joseph (2021), he stated 5 network security risks which are happened by human error: The 1st one is allow the attacker connects to the network easily and physically, such as from any network plug, inside the hospital. It may be an ethernet port on the back of the desktop hub, switch or router.
The 2nd one is the devices can be accessed by some 3rd parties. They can be medical device manufacturers, regulators, and so on. There is a risk for any 3rd party to access and attack the network.
The 3rd one is the hospital never expires any vulnerable devices, which may create security risk. For example, Windows XP and 7, which the Microsoft has stopped to provide any patch and service pack.
The 4th reason is the organization’s policies and assessing compliance are not enough to defend the devices from being compromised, even though they all are compliant. As the medical devices need to operate 24x7, the risk of data loss will be increased also.
