									<p>Here in this page, I posted some components of my reflection so that you can also find the whole reflection document at the link below.</p>
									<p>In the first collaborative discussion part I have posted and discussed about the health care cybersecurity industries threats and focused on Brute force attacks and denial-of-service.  Right now, it has come the momentous threats in the medical center. And most of medical center susceptibilities can concession clients’ statistics. Once observing at possible fears, Brute force attacks and denial-of-service are common. 
<p>In addition to my points my classmates (David Luvaha from Jan Küffner) also added their ideas on network hard ware replacement to support modern crypto algorithms to secure it . Since NHS Digital (2020) acknowledges that breaches related to security of associated medical hardware may lead to substantial interruption to the service operation in medical center.</p>
Besides the technical issues, another class mate Kin Wong considered human factor as a highest potential risk of health care cybersecurity industries. According to the Sky News today (2021) the IT systems of the Ireland’s health service are all being shut down because of significant ransomware attack, which maybe happened due to any human error. According to Joseph (2021), he stated 5 network security risks which are happened by human error. So that in my first collaborative discussion what I understand is that to make health care cybersecurity industries are stable and secure we should consider all issues which describe in the above and In my collaborative discussion 3 I raised an issue about CCTV data in a disciplinary This case study concerns on unfair use of CCTV data in a corrective procedure practicing on one staff. The foundation of the opposition being was unethically attained. And our tutor, Doug Millward also gave the following comments on this regard “it is good to highlights about processes, procedures, and the human element also It is worth considering how the data itself can be encoded as part of security precautions as well as looking at alternative mechanisms that may be usable”. So, I totally agreed with in the above comment.</p>

								<p>we have practiced on how to make basic penetration scan test individually and as a group.  In this test as group, we agreed that each individual person would conduct a basic scan each on the opposing groups website so that we could compare the results with each other. And Some of the results were vastly different across the board.</p>
								<p> In regards to my own individual results I used this web site “WEBSITE- http://nismphp-env.eba-ytbpbyww.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/” and I Perform a basic scan test using standard tools such as ping, traceroute, dig and nslookup in order to answer the following information:</p>
								<p>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website? -  I got Traceroute detected 21 hops, which step causes the biggest delay in the route? I got Hop 13, What is the average duration of that delay? -; I got Average duration- 96 ms (found from the ping test results), What are the main nameservers for the website? -I got Whois 'markmonitor.com', Who is the registered contact? – I got Amazon Technologies Inc. (AT-88-Z), What is the MX record for the website? – I got No MX record found and where is the website hosted? and I got Ashburn, Virginia, United States. In this exercise I have gained skill how to scan different website with different tools within different operating system.</p>
