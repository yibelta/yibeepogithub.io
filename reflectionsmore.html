									<p>Here in this page, I posted some components of my reflection so that you can also find the whole reflection document and other documents at the link below.Actually you can also find these all documents on the “ArteFacts page” </p>
									<p> In this research methods and professional practice modules I have learnt, understand and practices on different concepts like how to like what is  scientific Investigation and ethics, how to develop Research Questions, how to understand and review the Literature Review and what is and how to develop the research proposal, what is and how to develop research methods, what is and how to develop case studies, focus groups and observations, what is and how to develop interviews and survey methods questionnaire design, what is and how to assure validity and generalizability in research, what is and how to develop in analyzing qualitative data, what is and how to develop referential statistics and how to write research writings. With these all process I got knowledge and experiences as an individual. Just here below I would like to reflect or share my all journey in this module.
In my first collaborative discussion I posted and discussed about the U.S children internet protection Act (CIPA) mandate that public schools and libraries employ mechanisms to block inappropriate matters protect minors this supported by principle 1.1 protection due to wellbeing of others and environment. Blocker plus software is automated internet content filter to help the institution comply with CIPA this in line with principle 2.3 which include: develop your profession (knowledge, skill and competence) and maintaining awareness on recent technology. 
In summary part I posted and discussed about ACM code of ethics and professional, which concerns the quality of life of all people, affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society, its members, and the environment surrounding them. This obligation includes: Promoting fundamental human rights and protecting each individual’s right to autonomy. An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computing, including threats to health, safety, personal security, and privacy. 


In the case of my collaborative discussion two I raised about the accuracy of information on Whizzz cereal might seem a new topic for scientific world.  Based on the research outcome it is ethical for him to suggest analyzing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions with revision of methodology and possible scientific justification; When done so, the subsequent studies may either contradict or may show reduced or stronger effect size than the earlier ones (Grindrod, P. & Moreno, J,2018).
Manufacturer may publicize only the positive on even if unethical but Abi should use different mechanisms to communicate his research output with different stakeholders using presentation, publication and so on additionally he has to recommend and invite researcher for further study on Whizzz cereal. In addition to my point my classmates: Jan Kufner, Freya Basey and Samuel Tselapedi reflected their comments on my initial post respectively. Publishing the complete result herself, when Whizz is only publishing favorable results is a very good route to follow. There is however a more powerful alternative: As per Legal framework for European statistics Article 2 statistical principles (1c) the statistics must also be distributed in an impartial way. This requires the company to provide the study in an unbiased way, Whilst I agree with both Yibeltal and Jan on a moral level regarding Abi circumventing Whizzz to publish full results, due consideration should be given to the recourse that Abi may face. For example, a confidentiality agreement is likely to form part of Abi’s contract with Whizzz (Bott, 2014). And Misrepresentation of the results in a research report, manipulation of data analyses, and falsification of data represent research misconduct. The researcher’s realization that some other correlation could be performed on the results would cast the researched product more favorable. When committed intentionally, these actions can have serious consequences. Misconducts in research have severe ethical implications since they can potentially undermine the scientific integrity and credibility of the study. The integrity and credibility of the research findings may be questionable since the decision to explore other correlation methods was taken after realizing that the researched product has no nutritional value as hypothesized. And finally I summarized the my post in the following manner.
Ethical decisions are based on three main approaches: duty, rights and goal-based. The goal-based approach assumes that we should try to produce the greatest possible balance of value over disvalue. Discomfort to one individual or organization may be justified by the consequences for the society as a whole (Ron, 2020). According to the duty-based approach, your duty as a researcher is founded on your own moral principles. As a researcher, you will have a duty to yourself and to the individual who is participating in the research. So even if the outcome of the proposed research is for a good cause, if it involves the researcher lying or deceiving his subjects in some way, then this would be regarded as unethical. In the rights-based approach, the rights of the individual are assumed to be all-important (Rosnow and Rosenthal, 2011).
The ethical rules of research, like principles, are not absolute in that one may override another although clearly this must be justified. These rules are essential for the development of trust between researchers, organization and study participants. Fidelity means keeping our promises and avoiding negligence with information; For example, to send a summary of our true research findings to participants in a study we should do so (Ron.2020).
