											<p>Feedback from our tutor

Dear All
firstly, thanks very much to all of you for such a productive and active discussion forum - obviously the points raised in the paper struck many chords with you all.
From the point of view of the computer systems used for monitoring and configuration - I think there is very little for me to add. Many people made some excellent points about how to lock down the network and the use of AV, firewall, and IDS/IPS systems - all of which I think that medical services should take on board.
However, it is in the domain of embedded devices - the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) that the need for innovation and new solutions lies. The recent pandemic has demonstrated that the increasing number of electronic devices used for monitoring, managing, and ameliorating medical conditions absolutely need to be low maintenance, reliable and as immune to attack as possible. Unfortunately, all such devices will need interventions from time to time - whether it is basic monitoring, resynchronizing clocks, or carrying out software patching or updates, all such devices need a means of remote access. Performing surgery to access these devices is too expensive, time-consuming and in many cases introduces unneeded risks to the patient. However, as the many posts here attest, wireless communication is also fraught with risks and dangers. 
As cybersecurity specialists of the (near) future, we should regard this as one of the challenges of our field - cybersecurity is a big challenge in the IoT domain and we should be looking at new and innovative methods of securing these most vulnerable of devices.
For example - can we use blockchain programming techniques to make the communication links more secure? Many IoT devices use mesh networking because they have low power, limited range radios on-board. Is there any way of utilizing mesh networking techniques to also secure the network? Several people made some very good recommendations around locking down MAC addresses but should we still be looking at that level? Can IPv6, SDN, and VNFs be explored as alternative ways of addressing and securing such devices?
